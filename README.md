# Wondercity LLM Agents MOOC Hackathon project.


The goal of this project is to create an agentic LLM based app that allows kids to create
storytelling narratives using characters and plot twists of their choice.


## Getting Started

### 1. Create a virtual environment

First, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables

- Copy the `.env.sample` file to a new file named `.env`
- Fill in the `.env` file with your API keys

## Running the app

To run the app, use the following command:

```bash
chainlit run app.py -w
```

## Updating dependencies

If you need to update the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Update the `requirements.in` file with the new package or version.

2. Install `pip-tools` if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install pip-tools
   ```

3. Compile the new `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip-compile requirements.in
   ```

4. Install the updated dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This process ensures that all dependencies are properly resolved and pinned to specific versions for reproducibility.
